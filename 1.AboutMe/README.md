## Commercial Node.js Project: Driver Containerization at Amazon

One of my most impactful projects was leading the migration of a critical communication component in Amazon's Prime Video device farm, implemented using **Node.js**.

The device farm allows developers and QA engineers to remotely access devices and their peripherals (like webcams or infrared sensors) for testing. However, the communication between the gateway and devices relied on an outdated component built on SQS, which was no longer scalable. This caused bottlenecks and posed a serious risk to future expansion.

During an annual planning meeting, I highlighted these issues and convinced leadership to prioritize migrating this system to a modern IoT-based solution. I took full ownership of the project, created a plan with three milestones, and led the end-to-end migration using **Node.js**.

My work included:

- **Analyzing the existing infrastructure** to map out all dependencies.
- **Creating a proof of concept** to ensure the new IoT-based system would work for our needs.
- **Implementing the migration itself**, replacing the outdated SQS-based component with a scalable IoT-based solution.

The new system was scalable, more efficient, and removed a longstanding technical debt.

I was also assigned two junior developers to help with the migration. I onboarded and mentored them throughout the project, ensuring we delivered on time while building their skills.

This project required technical expertise in **Node.js**, strong planning, and collaboration skills. The results not only solved the scalability problem but also prepared the device farm for future growth. This experience demonstrates my ability to take ownership, deliver impactful solutions, and work closely with a team—qualities I’m excited to bring to the **Staff Full Stack Engineer** role at Reedsy.
